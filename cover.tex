\begin{letter}{Mckinsey Recruiting }
\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I am writing to express my interest in applying to the Senior Data Scientist position - Quantum Black at your organization in Riyadh. I am a Technical Solutions Architect and Data Scientist currently working for IBM Expert Labs. I have five years of experience working and leading the development of end to end AI solutions for our clients. Because of the nature of my role which requires working at all levels of the stack, besides working on complex machine learning tasks such as model building,  I have had the opportunity to gain experience in a wide variety of technologies -  I have worked with a variety of different databases, operating systems, container orchestration platforms ( Kubernetes and Openshift), front end frameworks (React and Vue), and machine learning frameworks, mainly PyTorch and SparkMLLib. I love solving difficult programming challenges, and I focus always on practical and simple solutions that drive value. Most recently I have developed a Gen AI virtual assistant to support an order management processing application for a large retailer. 

I have always been  interested in working at Mckinsey because of the prospect and opportunity they offer of being able to solve difficult problems for engaged clients with professional coworkers.I'd be very grateful for the opportunity to speak to you further about the position and evaluate whether my experience and skill set are an appropriate match for the role.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\ps
